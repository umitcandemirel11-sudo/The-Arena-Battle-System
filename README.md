# 🏟️ The Arena: Battle System

A Python-based, dynamic RPG battle simulation. This project was developed to combine fundamental programming logic with game mechanics.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dynamic Character System:** Character stats managed using dictionary data structures.  
- **Modular Battle Mechanics:** Functions for damage calculation, defense reduction, and health control.  
- **Advanced Game Loop:** A `while` loop structure that continues until a character’s health reaches zero.  
- **Randomization:** Critical hits and variable damage factors added to each strike using the `random` library.  

## 🛠️ Technical Details

The following software engineering concepts are applied in this project:

- **Pass by Reference:** Dictionaries (character cards) passed into functions are permanently updated inside.  
- **Encapsulation:** Separation of data and the logic that processes this data.  
- **Conditionals:** Advanced `if-else` blocks to check whether a character survives or dies.  

## 🕹️ How to Run

1. Clone the project or download the `main.py` file.  
2. Open your terminal/command line.  
3. Run the following command:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
